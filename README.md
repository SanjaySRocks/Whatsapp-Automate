# Whatsapp Automate

A whatsapp bot to automatic reply or send message to number

It uses Puppeteer to run a real instance of Whatsapp Web to avoid getting blocked.

NOTE: I can't guarantee you will not be blocked by using this method, although it has worked for me. WhatsApp does not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, so this shouldn't be considered totally safe.
